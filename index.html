      <h2>Full Stack Developer</h2>
      <p>
        Currently a student developer at <a href="https://www.lewagon.com/">Le Wagon</a>. I was a Civil Engineer working with a global design consultancy focused on large scale infrastructure. I decided that was not what I wanted to be doing with my life and would rather be coding and implementing new products or ideas. Always been tech savvy and now I want to take that to the next level and really get involved development and coding. Definitely a bit of a back end guru now that I have had 3 weeks at Le Wagon.
